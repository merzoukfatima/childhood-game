# Catch the Ball Game

A simple yet fun game inspired by a childhood memory. The game involves a ball moving randomly inside a rectangle, and the player needs to catch it. Each level increases the speed of the ball, making it more challenging. Scores are tracked and stored using a simple authentication system with Supabase.
